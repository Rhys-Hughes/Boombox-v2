# Boombox-v2
Sound board software that allows a user to play sounds as if coming from their microphone, usable for voice calls, gaming, and video production.

Created to be light weight and easy to use, i created the V1 of this some months ago over the course of a week or so, it was rushed and frankly shoddy code wich i have decided to completely rebuild with OOP principles in mind.
The idea for this initially came from my desire to have a personal soundboard to use, when searching i found many paid ones, and the free ones where clunky and filled with things i didn't want or need, therefore i decided to make my own.
Overkill? maybe. But i have learned a lot from this so far, it has been really interesting and a good way to keep myself sharp.

Development is ongoing and likely will be for some time until i am happy with the outcome.
